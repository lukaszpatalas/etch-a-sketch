# etch-a-sketch
Project based on assignment from The Odin Project

I will use CSS Grid and try to learn it on the go, as I never used 
it before. It will be fun.

Goals:

1. Glance through CSS Grid to have basic understanding needed for 
the project.
2. Try not to mix CSS code inside javascript function, but separate
style from logic.

What to fix:

1. Try to create shorter, more atomic functions.
2. Think of the way to remove global variables.
