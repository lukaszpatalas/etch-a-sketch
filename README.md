# etch-a-sketch
Project based on assignment from The Odin Project

I will use CSS Grid and try to learn it on the go, as I never used 
it before. It will be fun.

Goals:

1. Glance through CSS Grid to have basic understanding needed for 
the project.
2. Try not to mix CSS code inside javascript function, but separate
style from logic.
3. Try to create shorter, more atomic functions in contrast to
previous projects.
